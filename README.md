# fraud_detection
Here I will take credit card transactions, analyse the data, create the features and labels and finally apply the Decision Tree Machine Learning algorithm to judge the nature of transaction as being fraud or not. Then I will find out the accuracy, precision as well as f-score of the model we have chosen.

Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud
